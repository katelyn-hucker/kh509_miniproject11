# Week 11: Data Pipeline with Databricks
This week's miniproject uses Azure Databricks to create a pipeline using the [lab's song dataset](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/data-pipeline-get-started.html). I conntected my Azure account to my github repo, and was able to push the three files: Ingest, Prepare, Analyze directly from Azure. I then used the Create Workflow setting in Azure to run all three of these files in a data pipeline. You can see screenshots of my Azure workflow below.
